## Safe Update Strategy with Medical Application Constraints

### Phase 1: Critical Security Patches (Days 1-2)
**Objective**: Address critical JWT vulnerability immediately while maintaining system stability

#### 1.1 Authlib Security Update
```bash
# CRITICAL: Update authlib to fix JWT vulnerability
# Test in isolated environment first
pip install authlib==1.6.4
```

**Risk Assessment**: LOW - Authlib 1.6.3‚Üí1.6.4 is a security patch with minimal breaking changes
**Medical Safety**: HIGH PRIORITY - JWT vulnerability directly affects access control
**Rollback Plan**: Keep authlib==1.6.3 as backup, test authentication flows thoroughly

#### 1.2 PyTorch Security Update
```bash
# Update PyTorch to address DoS vulnerability
# Requires careful ML pipeline testing
pip install torch==2.8.0
```

**Risk Assessment**: MEDIUM - PyTorch major version updates can affect ML model compatibility
**Medical Safety**: MEDIUM PRIORITY - May affect AI-based features
**Rollback Plan**: Comprehensive ML pipeline testing required before deployment

### Phase 2: Framework Security Updates (Days 3-5)
**Objective**: Address FastAPI/Starlette vulnerabilities with extensive testing

#### 2.1 Starlette/FastAPI Verification and Update
```bash
# First, verify current vulnerability status
pip show fastapi starlette
# Update if needed (determine latest secure versions)
pip install fastapi==0.118.0 starlette==0.40.0
```

**Risk Assessment**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Web framework updates can affect API behavior
**Medical Safety**: HIGH PRIORITY - API stability critical for medical system
**Testing Required**: Full API endpoint testing, CORS verification, middleware compatibility

#### 2.2 NumPy Update Strategy
```bash
# Gradual NumPy update with compatibility testing
# Note: NumPy 2.x has breaking changes from 1.x
pip install numpy==2.3.3
```

**Risk Assessment**: HIGH - NumPy 2.x introduces breaking changes
**Medical Safety**: HIGH PRIORITY - Mathematical operations must remain accurate
**Alternative**: Consider numpy==1.26.4‚Üí1.26.5+ if 2.x breaks compatibility
