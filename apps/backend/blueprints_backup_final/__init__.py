Flask Blueprints - Consolidated Architecture
Strategic consolidation from 20â†’8 blueprints for maintainability
Organized by domain responsibility and functional cohesion
"""

# === CONSOLIDATED 8-BLUEPRINT ARCHITECTURE ===
# Strategic consolidation preserving 100% functionality

# 1. CORE: Chat + Personas + Health (core medical functionality)
from .core_blueprint import core_bp

# 2. USER: User + Auth + Profiles (complete user management)
from .user_blueprint import user_bp

# 3. ANALYTICS: Analytics + Metrics + Monitoring + Observability (telemetry)
from .analytics_blueprint_consolidated import analytics_bp

# 4. ENGAGEMENT: Gamification + Notifications + Feedback (user engagement)
from .engagement_blueprint import engagement_bp

# 5. VALIDATION: Medical validation + QA framework (compliance)
from .validation_blueprint import validation_bp

# 6. MULTIMODAL: Image/document processing (specialized)
from .multimodal_blueprint import multimodal_bp

# 7. CACHE: Critical performance layer (specialized)
from .cache_blueprint import cache_blueprint

# 8. DOCS: API documentation + Swagger (development support)
from .docs_blueprint import docs_bp

# === LEGACY SUPPORT & OPTIONAL SYSTEMS ===
# Maintained for transition period and specialized needs
from .memory_blueprint import memory_bp
from .logging_blueprint import logging_bp
from core.openapi.spec import swagger_ui_blueprint
