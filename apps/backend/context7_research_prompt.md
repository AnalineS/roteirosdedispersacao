# Context7 Research Prompt - google-cloud-logging Dependency Analysis

use context7

## Objective
Research Python package `google-cloud-logging` dependency requirements to resolve pip "resolution-too-deep" error when upgrading from 3.10.0 to 3.12.1.

## Required Information

### 1. Version 3.12.1 (Target Version)
- Complete dependency list with exact version constraints
- Required versions of:
  - `proto-plus`
  - `grpcio-status`
  - `google-api-core`
  - `google-cloud-core`
- Changelog and release notes
- Breaking changes from 3.10.0
- Known compatibility issues
- Python version requirements

### 2. Version 3.11.4 (Intermediate Version - Safer Option)
- Complete dependency list with exact version constraints
- Comparison with 3.12.1 dependencies
- Stability and maturity level
- Is this recommended as stepping stone from 3.10.0?

### 3. Version 3.11.0 (First 3.11.x Release)
- Dependency requirements
- Major changes from 3.10.0
- Risk assessment for upgrade

### 4. Version 3.10.0 (Current Version)
- Current dependency requirements for baseline comparison
- Known limitations or security issues

## Dependency Conflict Context

**Error:** `pip resolution-too-deep` when upgrading 3.10.0 → 3.12.1

**Conflicting packages identified in CI/CD:**
- `proto-plus` (version conflicts)
- `grpcio-status` (version conflicts)
- `importlib-metadata` (versions 6.0-7.1 conflict)
- `click-option-group` (versions 0.5.0-0.5.7)
- `colorama` (0.4.0-0.4.5)
- `exceptiongroup` (1.2.0-1.2.1)
- `semgrep` (1.113.0-1.139.0)

**Current environment:**
- Python: 3.11.13 (CI/CD) / 3.13.5 (local)
- pip: latest
- Other Google Cloud packages:
  - `google-cloud-monitoring==2.27.2`
  - `google-cloud-storage>=2.10.0`

## Analysis Needed

1. **Dependency Version Ranges:**
   - Which versions of proto-plus work with each google-cloud-logging version?
   - Which versions of grpcio-status are compatible?
   - Are there upper/lower bounds that changed between versions?

2. **Conflict Resolution:**
   - Why does 3.12.1 cause resolution-too-deep but 3.10.0 doesn't?
   - Are there transitive dependency issues?
   - Do we need to pin specific intermediate packages?

3. **Upgrade Strategy:**
   - Recommended incremental path: 3.10.0 → ? → ?
   - Should we pin proto-plus/grpcio-status to specific versions?
   - Alternative: stay on 3.10.0 if no security issues?

4. **Security Assessment:**
   - Are there security vulnerabilities in 3.10.0?
   - Are security patches in 3.12.1 critical?
   - Can we safely defer to 3.11.x?

## Desired Output Format

```yaml
version_3_12_1:
  dependencies:
    proto-plus: ">=X.Y.Z,<A.B.C"
    grpcio-status: ">=X.Y.Z"
    # ... all deps
  breaking_changes: []
  security_fixes: []
  risk_level: high|medium|low

version_3_11_4:
  dependencies:
    proto-plus: ">=X.Y.Z,<A.B.C"
    # ... all deps
  recommended_as_intermediate: yes|no
  risk_level: high|medium|low

version_3_10_0:
  dependencies:
    proto-plus: ">=X.Y.Z,<A.B.C"
    # ... all deps
  known_issues: []
  security_status: secure|vulnerable

recommended_strategy:
  approach: incremental|direct|defer
  steps:
    - action: "upgrade to X.Y.Z"
      reason: "..."
  pins_required:
    proto-plus: "==X.Y.Z"
```

## Success Criteria

✅ Identify exact dependency version constraints for all three versions
✅ Understand why 3.12.1 causes resolution-too-deep
✅ Provide safe, incremental upgrade path
✅ Determine if pins are needed for proto-plus/grpcio-status
✅ Assess security implications of staying on older version
