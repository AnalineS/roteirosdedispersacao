    # Remove potential medical identifiers
    sanitized = re.sub(r'\b\d{3}\.\d{3}\.\d{3}-\d{2}\b', '[CPF_REDACTED]', log_message)
    sanitized = re.sub(r'\b\d{11}\b', '[PHONE_REDACTED]', sanitized)
    # Add medical data patterns
    return sanitized

# Apply to all logger.info(), logger.error(), etc.
```

#### LGPD Compliance Framework
```python
# Data classification for medical platform
class MedicalDataClassifier:
    SENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [
        'patient', 'consultation', 'medical_history',
        'diagnosis', 'treatment', 'medication'
    ]

    def classify_and_protect(self, data):
        # Implement data protection based on LGPD requirements
        pass
```
